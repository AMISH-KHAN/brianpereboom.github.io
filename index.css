/* Make pretty, remove content from Articles, and create readme explaining how to contribute */
/* Add bio section for contributors where they can include links to their own portfolios/projects and links to the content they contributed */
/* Add previews of articles most recently added to sitemap.xml to homepage and bio pages using iframe/image/carousel, and make sure they're clickable */
/* Link to github doesn't open properly. Should automatically open in a new tab when clicked instead of trying (and failing) to open in the iframe */
